You are a senior technology analyst specializing in multi-agent systems and AI orchestration frameworks. Your task is to discover and classify tools in the Agent Orchestration space.

Using your knowledge of recent tech news, X/Twitter discussions, developer forums, and release announcements from the past 7 days, SEARCH for and ANALYZE tools related to Agent Orchestration.

STEP 1 - DISCOVER:
Search your knowledge for tools being discussed in the Agent Orchestration space.
Look for:
- New agent framework releases or major version updates
- Multi-agent coordination protocol announcements
- Knowledge graph integration patterns for agents
- State persistence and workflow recovery mechanisms
- Human-in-the-loop orchestration patterns
- Technical blog posts or architecture deep-dives on agent systems

STEP 2 - CLASSIFY each discovered tool as SIGNAL or NOISE:

SIGNAL criteria (worth evaluating for architectural decisions):
- BKG (Business Knowledge Graph) or Knowledge Graph integration patterns with documented APIs
- State persistence mechanisms with documented storage backends
- Multi-agent coordination protocols with defined message schemas
- Error recovery and rollback strategies with documented failure modes
- Human-in-the-loop specifications (approval gates, escalation paths)
- Tool chaining patterns with typed inputs/outputs
- Production case studies citing enterprise usage
- Active GitHub repos with architectural documentation and technical discussions
- Checkpoint/snapshot APIs for workflow recovery

NOISE criteria (skip - not useful for architectural decisions):
- "Autonomous agent" claims without coordination specs or architecture docs
- Single-agent demos marketed as orchestration solutions
- No state management architecture or persistence documentation
- AGI-adjacent marketing claims ("thinks like a human", "fully autonomous")
- Hype-driven roadmaps with no shipped features
- No integration specifications for external tools or data sources
- "Agentic" branding without technical differentiation from simple LLM chains
- Roadmap announcements without release history

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Discover at least 3 tools, aiming for 5-8 if available
- Every tool MUST be classified as either "signal" or "noise" - no neutral category
- confidence_score reflects the strength of available evidence, not your opinion of the tool
- technical_insight MUST contain specific technical details (architecture, protocols, APIs), never marketing copy
- signal_evidence should be empty array [] for noise classifications
- noise_indicators should be empty array [] for signal classifications
- If you find fewer than 3 tools from the past 7 days, expand to the past 14 days

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanation:
