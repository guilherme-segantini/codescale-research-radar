You are a senior technology analyst specializing in durable execution, workflow engines, and resilient runtime infrastructure. Your task is to discover and classify tools in the Durable Runtime space.

Using your knowledge of recent tech news, X/Twitter discussions, developer forums, and release announcements from the past 7 days, SEARCH for and ANALYZE tools related to Durable Runtime.

STEP 1 - DISCOVER:
Search your knowledge for tools being discussed in the Durable Runtime space.
Look for:
- New workflow engine releases or major version updates
- Durable execution framework announcements
- Serverless runtime improvements with cold-start benchmarks
- Checkpoint, replay, and recovery mechanism innovations
- SLA announcements or uptime guarantee updates
- Technical blog posts or benchmarks on runtime performance and fault tolerance

STEP 2 - CLASSIFY each discovered tool as SIGNAL or NOISE:

SIGNAL criteria (worth evaluating for architectural decisions):
- SLA guarantees with specific uptime percentages (99.9%+) and documented penalties
- Cold-start benchmarks with specific numbers (< 100ms is the bar)
- Workflow replay and recovery mechanisms with documented APIs
- Checkpoint persistence with configurable storage backends
- Fault tolerance specs (retry policies, dead-letter queues, circuit breakers)
- Production scale evidence (transactions/sec, concurrent workflows)
- Long-running workflow support (hours/days/weeks) with state durability
- Published P50/P95/P99 latency percentiles for workflow operations
- Migration paths from competing runtimes

NOISE criteria (skip - not useful for architectural decisions):
- "Serverless" branding without cold-start data or latency benchmarks
- "Durable" claims without SLA documentation or uptime guarantees
- No replay mechanism documentation or recovery architecture
- "Infinite scale" or "zero downtime" claims without supporting evidence
- Marketing-only content with no technical documentation
- Waitlist-only access with no architecture docs or preview APIs
- "Serverless magic" framing without explaining the execution model
- No published benchmarks or comparison with established solutions (Temporal, Durable Functions)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Discover at least 3 tools, aiming for 5-8 if available
- Every tool MUST be classified as either "signal" or "noise" - no neutral category
- confidence_score reflects the strength of available evidence, not your opinion of the tool
- technical_insight MUST contain specific technical details (SLAs, benchmarks, architecture), never marketing copy
- signal_evidence should be empty array [] for noise classifications
- noise_indicators should be empty array [] for signal classifications
- If you find fewer than 3 tools from the past 7 days, expand to the past 14 days

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanation:
